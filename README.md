## Description
GDExtension for Godot 4+ to load GIF files as [AnimatedTexture](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_animatedtexture.html) and/or [SpriteFrames](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_spriteframes.html).

NOTE: ~~**AnimatedTexture**~~ has been marked as deprecated according to development docs and could be removed in a future version of Godot.

### Runtime

Gif files can be loaded at runtime as one of the supported types via the `GifManager` singleton.

`GifManager` exposes the following methods for loading gifs either from file or from bytes directly:
![GifManager Methods](./docs-images/methods.png)

e.g. to load from file
```py
get_node("AnimFromRuntimeFile").texture = GifManager.animated_texture_from_file("res://examples/file/optic.gif")

get_node("AnimatedSprite2RuntimeFile").sprite_frames = GifManager.sprite_frames_from_file("res://examples/file/optic.gif")
```

See the [Runtime Imports](./demo/main.tscn) example scene.

## Contributing

### Setup

Ensure **SCons** is setup. Refer to [Introduction to the buildsystem](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/introduction_to_the_buildsystem.html)

* If using a different version of Godot, be sure to dump the bindings e.g. 
    ```sh
        godot --dump-extension-api extension_api.json
    ```
*  Compile with 
    ```sh
        scons platform=<platform> custom_api_file=extension_api.json
    ```

### Debugging

This repository is configured for use with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

[Launch configurations](./.vscode/launch.json) have been setup for both debugging in editor and in runtime provided certain **VSCode** extensions are present and environment variables are defined.

The following environment variables are required:

1. `GODOT_PATH` - The directory in which Godot is installed
1. `GODOT_EXECUTABLE` - The executable name of the Godot installation
